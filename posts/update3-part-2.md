### What's next

Next I want to go deeper on what a user sees and what a users is able to interact with as the battle is going on.  

Here are some ideas I came up with:

- Items on map that characters can pick up

- Calculate a characters movement speed and show how far a character can move in a turn

- Selectable abilities for characters

- Different visual states for which character is selected (player character vs. someone else's character vs. npc)

- (Maybe) multi-room maps

- Turn tracking for battles

- (Maybe) logic for starting battles.

### More planning needed

I think I will break these items across multiple chunks of work (at least 2).  If I have smaller, well defined chunks of work, that makes it easier to work on this project consistently and efficiently.  So I am going to do some more thinking about what items I want work on next, and what the best way to organize those items into chunks of work are.

### Making a UI mockup

I also used figma to make a UI mock of what this could look like.  It helps me visualize what the browser will need to render on the screen, and where I will need to add interactivity to the page.

Here is what I have so far:
