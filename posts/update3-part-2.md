### What's next

Next I want to go deeper on what a user sees and what a users is able to interact with as the battle is going on.  

Here are some ideas I came up with:

- Items on map that characters can pick up

- Calculate a characters movement speed and show how far a character can move in a turn

- Selectable abilities for characters

- Different visual states for which character is selected (player character vs. someone else's character vs. npc)

- (Maybe) multi-room maps

- Turn tracking for battles

- (Maybe) logic for starting battles.
